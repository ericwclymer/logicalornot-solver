Solver for https://github.com/Zhouzi/logicalornot

Gabin Aureche (http://gabinaureche.com/) has a cool javascript game at http://gabinaureche.com/logicalornot/. 

It's often said that developers are inherently lazy, so rather than trying for hours to see how high of a score I could achieve, I wrote a solver to achieve (as far as I can tell) a limitless score.

To run, simply paste the script into the console of your favorite browser (only tested in Chrome)
